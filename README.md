# Contextuality and inductive bias in quatum machine learning models: numerical study

This repository contains the code used to generate the plots in the paper. 

The quantum circuit simulation is done in pennylane using JAX for vectorisation
and gradient computation. The surrogate model is build in JAX. The JAX optimisation
package optax is used to train the models.
